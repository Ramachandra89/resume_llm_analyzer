# resume_llm_analyzer
Objective is to self-host an LLM using AWS and ask the user to input resume and a job description (JD) which the LLM would compare to generate a coaching report. Improve LLM inference using prompt engineering. Provide a resume/JD matching score (cosine similarity) before and after incorporating suggestions from hosted LLM.
